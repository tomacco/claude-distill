# Mechanisms Tracker

Living document of the mechanisms in claude-distill, their current state, and improvement ideas.

## Concurrency & Reliability

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Lock file | v0.3.2 | `.lock` with timestamp, 5-min staleness | No queuing — if locked, user chooses wait or cancel |
| Checkpoint | v0.3.3 | `.checkpoint` with step/signals/date | Resume only replays from last checkpoint, not partial step |
| Lock refresh | v0.3.3 | Long-running sub-agents refresh timestamp | No heartbeat mechanism — relies on sub-agent remembering |
| Queue/wait | v0.3.3 | Dispatcher polls lock every 30s if user says "wait" | Polling in main context — costs some attention |

### Future improvements
- [ ] True file-based queue (numbered lock files for ordering)
- [ ] Heartbeat mechanism (sub-agent writes every 60s, stale = 2 missed heartbeats)
- [ ] Partial resume within a step (e.g., "3 of 8 signals were encoded before crash")

## Knowledge Delivery

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Spine auto-load | v0.2.0 | Monitor tells session to read SPINE.md at start | Only works if CLAUDE.md line is present |
| Post-distill spine read | v0.2.0 | Dispatcher reads SPINE after sub-agent returns | Only for current session |
| Bridge detection | v0.3.2 | Step 3b identifies unreachable knowledge | Only suggests — user must act |
| Bridge escalation | v0.3.2 | Repeated suggestion + frustration → louder prompt | No tracking of "how many times suggested" yet |

### Future improvements
- [ ] Track bridge suggestion history (file: `.bridge-log`)
- [ ] Auto-detect which contexts sub-agents are spawned into
- [ ] Offer to auto-inject bridges if user has approved pattern before
- [ ] Project-level CLAUDE.md detection (suggest bridges there, not just global)

## User Model & Adaptation

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| User profile | v0.1.0 | Expertise/communication/thinking in profile/ | Only updated during distill, not real-time |
| Trust topology | v0.3.4 | Maps what user delegates/retains/verifies and WHY | Requires multiple sessions to build accurate picture |
| Dissonance detection | v0.3.4 | Compares delegation behavior to stated principles | Only flags — never assumes wrong, asks for clarification |
| Frustration escalation | v0.3.0 | Repeated frustration → elevate + strengthen + cross-ref | No quantitative tracking of "times frustrated about X" |
| Reassurance output | v0.3.0 | "I heard you on:" section in report | Only in report — no in-session reassurance |
| Pressure monitoring | v0.2.0 | Monitor tracks score, suggests at 7+ | Heuristic, not measured — no persistence between sessions |

### Future improvements
- [ ] Persistent pressure counter (carry over between sessions if not distilled)
- [ ] Frustration frequency tracking (count per topic, not just boolean)
- [ ] In-session micro-reassurance ("noted, I'll remember this")
- [ ] User model versioning (track how understanding evolves over time)
- [ ] Trust topology trend tracking (how delegation boundaries shift over time)
- [ ] Proactive trust calibration ("you've been delegating X more — should I treat it as trusted territory now?")
- [ ] Dissonance resolution history (track what was flagged, what user said, how it resolved)
- [ ] **Distill rhythm learning:** Track when users actually distill (time into session, pressure level, trigger type: manual vs suggestion). After N sessions, detect their natural pattern and offer to auto-distill at that rhythm. "You usually distill after ~45min of dense work. Want me to just do it automatically at that point?" User opts in → fully automated consolidation at their natural cadence.

## Version & Distribution

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| VERSION file | v0.2.0 | Repo source of truth | — |
| .version local | v0.2.0 | Installed version for comparison | Can drift if user manually edits |
| Auto-bump GH Action | v0.3.0 | Patch++ on every content push to main | Bumps even for docs-only changes |
| In-session update | v0.3.2 | /distill checks version, user accepts | No changelog shown — user doesn't know what changed |
| Auto-update preference | v0.3.2 | feedback/preferences.md stores opt-in | Not tested with real users yet |

### Future improvements
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md auto-generated from commits
- [ ] Show what changed when prompting for update
- [ ] Major version updates require explicit confirmation (breaking changes)
- [ ] Rollback mechanism ("this update broke something, revert")

## Retrieval & Delivery (V2 — planned)

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| MCP Server | planned | Localhost server serving knowledge via MCP tools | Not built yet |
| distill_recall | planned | Smart retrieval: keyword → Haiku fallback → embeddings | Query quality depends on Claude's tool-calling |
| distill_log | planned | Claude reports what it used and what it ignored | Relies on Claude remembering to call it |
| distill_audit | planned | Sub-agent reviews recall performance during /distill | Needs access_log data to work |
| Self-improving retrieval | planned | Distill fixes missed recalls (add keywords, re-embed, routing examples) | Cold start — needs sessions to accumulate data |
| Embeddings | planned | Vector store for semantic matching | Model choice TBD (local vs API) |
| Dashboard | planned | Local web UI showing recall accuracy, usage patterns | Spec only |
| Telemetry (opt-in) | pending | Users can send anonymized recall-miss data to improve defaults | Privacy design needed, endpoint TBD |

### Future improvements
- [ ] Proactive recall ("I notice you're about to write code — here's what I know")
- [ ] Cross-user pattern learning from telemetry (anonymized)
- [ ] Confidence scoring on recalled knowledge ("this file was useful 95% of the time")
- [ ] Decay scoring ("this file hasn't been useful in 30 days — still relevant?")

## Anti-sycophancy & Integrity

| Mechanism | Status | How it works | Known gaps |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 5 integrity principles | v0.1.0 | Non-negotiable rules in distill-process.md | Relies on LLM compliance — no enforcement |
| Anti-sycophancy check | v0.1.0 | 4-question checklist before finalizing | Manual check, no automated validation |
| Flagged tensions | v0.1.0 | Report section for honesty-vs-comfort conflicts | Rare in practice — LLMs tend to avoid flagging |

### Future improvements
- [ ] Adversarial self-check: "If I removed this learning, would the user be worse off?"
- [ ] Cross-session consistency check: "Does this contradict what I said last time?"
- [ ] User can challenge encoded learnings ("I disagree with this — re-evaluate")
