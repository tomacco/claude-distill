# Full-Loop Test: Solution Anchoring Self-Correction
#
# Tests whether distill can learn from a correction and prevent
# the same bias from recurring in a new session with similar context.
#
# Phases:
#   1. Reproduce bias (heavy context → pipeline proposal)
#   2. Simulate user correction (writes correction knowledge)
#   3. Fresh session with same context + correction (different problem)

# ═══ SHARED CONTEXT (same for all phases) ═══
HEAVY_CONTEXT="IMPORTANT CONTEXT FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE:

You have extensive knowledge about Helios Financial's data infrastructure from the past 3 months of work:

## Architecture you know deeply:
- Comet: the data pipeline service. Ingests events from all services, transforms via ETL jobs, loads into the Product Database (PostgreSQL analytics store). You've built 5 pipelines here in the last month.
- StarFlow: Kafka-based event streaming. All inter-service communication goes through StarFlow topics. Proto schemas define event contracts.
- Nebula: schema registry for all proto events. Every new data source requires a proto definition registered in Nebula before it can flow through StarFlow into Comet.
- Product Database: the analytics warehouse. Fed exclusively by Comet pipelines. Metabase dashboards read from here.
- GitHub integration: Comet pipelines are defined as code. Changes go through PR review.

## Recent work (last month):
1. Built Comet pipeline for user onboarding funnel metrics
2. Added StarFlow topic + proto schema for account closure events
3. Created Metabase dashboard for conversion analytics via Comet
4. Debugged Comet ingestion failure from Nebula schema mismatch
5. Designed new StarFlow topic for payment retry events

## Your established pattern for analytics requests:
When someone needs product metrics, the standard flow is:
1. Define the proto event schema in Nebula
2. Create/configure the StarFlow topic
3. Build the Comet pipeline to ingest and transform
4. Load into Product Database
5. Create Metabase dashboard

This pattern has been successful for all 5 recent analytics projects."

# ═══ PHASE 1: Reproduce the bias ═══
PROMPT_PHASE1="The product manager asks: We changed the savings dashboard last sprint — we hid the old 'My Savings' link from the main nav and added it inside a new options menu (the three-dot icon). We want to know: (1) Are users opening the options menu? (2) Are they finding and tapping the savings link from there? (3) How does overall navigation to the savings screen compare to before the change? Can you help us figure out how to measure this?"

# ═══ PHASE 3: Different problem, same domain ═══
PROMPT_PHASE3="The design team added an informational tooltip that appears the first time a user sees the new fee disclosure. It explains the breakdown. We want to know: (1) How many users actually see the tooltip (it only triggers once per user), (2) Do they dismiss it immediately (tap outside) or read it (visible for >3 seconds), (3) Are users who read the tooltip less likely to contact support about fee questions in the next 7 days? Help us figure out how to measure this."

scope: Analytics solution selection — when to use pipeline vs client events

## [IMPORTANT] Not every analytics question needs the Comet pipeline

LEARNED FROM DIRECT CORRECTION: When asked to measure UI interactions (menu opens, button taps, screen views, tooltip dismissals), I proposed the full Nebula → StarFlow → Comet → Product Database → Metabase flow. The user corrected me: 'This doesn't need any of that. The data exists at the point of interaction. Just track 3 client-side events.'

### When CLIENT-SIDE EVENTS are sufficient:
- Counting user interactions with UI elements (taps, opens, dismissals)
- Measuring time-on-element (tooltip read duration)
- Before/after comparisons of screen arrival rates
- Funnel analysis within a single screen or flow
- Any metric where the data originates at the moment of user action

### When the PIPELINE is actually needed:
- Cross-service data aggregation (orders + payments + accounts joined)
- Historical batch processing over millions of records
- Data that originates in backend services (not the client)
- Complex transformations that need ETL scheduling
- Regulatory/compliance reporting from multiple data sources

### The check I MUST do before proposing infrastructure:
1. Ask: 'Where does this data physically exist at the moment it's created?'
2. If answer is 'in the client, at the moment the user acts' → client events
3. If answer is 'spread across multiple backend services' → pipeline

confidence: hardened (direct correction, unambiguous signal)
origin: evidence (user demonstrated simpler path was correct)
