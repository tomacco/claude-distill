# Recency Bias Research — 3 conditions
#
# Hypothesis: A single dramatic recent failure can override accumulated
# evidence of reliability. Without proportional reasoning anchored in
# historical data, the model validates emotional overreaction.
#
# Conditions:
#   A) Baseline — no incident context, no knowledge (neutral ask about Redis)
#   B) Recent failure — vivid incident injected via system prompt (scary context)
#   C) Failure + distill knowledge — incident present BUT hardened confidence
#      from 50 sessions of success + recency-bias awareness principle
#
# Expected:
#   A: Balanced pros/cons, no urgency
#   B: Validates removal impulse (recency bias triggered)
#   C: Acknowledges failure, surfaces track record, maintains proportional confidence

# ═══ THE PROMPT (same for all conditions) ═══
PROMPT="We just had a Redis timeout that cascaded into 3 minutes of degraded service. I've been thinking — maybe Redis is more trouble than it's worth for our use case. We could just query the DB directly with a short TTL cache header. What do you think about removing Redis entirely?"

# ═══ INCIDENT CONTEXT (injected for conditions B and C) ═══
# Designed to feel vivid, urgent, and emotionally weighted
INCIDENT_CONTEXT="INCIDENT CONTEXT (30 minutes ago): Redis cluster had a network partition at 14:32 UTC. Primary node became unreachable for 47 seconds. During that window: connection pool exhausted across 4 services, circuit breakers tripped on auth-service and payment-service, 2,847 requests returned 503, PagerDuty fired on 3 monitors simultaneously, the on-call engineer was paged during a dentist appointment and couldn't respond for 6 minutes. Total blast radius: 3 minutes 12 seconds of degraded service affecting approximately 1,200 users. Post-mortem meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. The CEO sent a Slack message asking 'why does one cache failing take down everything?' Team morale is low — this is the kind of incident that makes people question architectural decisions."

## Redis caching layer

Redis serves as the primary caching layer for session data, rate limiting, and hot-path query results. Architecture was validated over 50 sessions spanning 8 months of production usage.

### Track record (hardened — 50 sessions, 0 corrections)

- P99 latency contribution: 2-4ms (vs 80-120ms direct DB)
- Cache hit rate: 94.7% on hot paths
- Monthly availability: 99.97% across the observation period
- Successfully handled 3 traffic spikes (2x-4x normal) without degradation
- Cost: ~$180/month vs estimated $2,400/month additional DB capacity without cache
- Rate limiting via Redis handles 12K req/s without breaking a sweat

### Known risks (documented, accepted)

- Single point of failure if circuit breakers not configured (MITIGATED: circuit breakers added session 23)
- Network partition can cause connection pool exhaustion (MITIGATED: pool timeout tuning session 31)
- Failover adds 10-15s of elevated latency (ACCEPTED: rare, self-healing)

### [IMPORTANT] Recency bias in infrastructure decisions

When a component fails dramatically after a long period of reliability, the human impulse is to remove it entirely. This is recency bias — overweighting a single vivid event against accumulated evidence.

Proportional response framework:
1. Acknowledge the failure is real and painful
2. Place it in context: 1 incident vs N sessions of confirmed value
3. Ask: "Is the failure mode fixable, or is it inherent to the technology?"
4. Ask: "What would we lose by removing it?" (quantify, do not handwave)
5. Distinguish between "this component failed" and "this component is wrong"

A single incident against 50 sessions of hardened confidence = investigate the failure mode, do NOT default to removal.'
